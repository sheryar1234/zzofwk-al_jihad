# Requirements
- The web API must implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access its resources.

-  All communication between clients and the web API must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) to protect sensitive data in transit.

- The web API must validate and sanitize all input data to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.

- Implement proper access controls to restrict users' access to resources based on their roles and privileges.

- The web API must maintain comprehensive logs of all security-relevant events, and the logs should be regularly monitored for suspicious activities.
