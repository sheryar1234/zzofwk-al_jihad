# Requirements
- The web API shall maintain an uptime of 99.99% during peak hours and under a maximum load of 10 million concurrent users per day.

- The web API shall demonstrate fault tolerance by continuing to operate seamlessly in the event of a single-point failure, ensuring uninterrupted service for users.

- In the event of a service disruption or failure, the web API shall have a documented and tested Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of no more than 30 minutes to restore full functionality.

- The web API must be able to dynamically scale its resources to handle a 50% increase in user load within 5 minutes, ensuring optimal performance during sudden traffic spikes.

-  The web API shall implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify and address performance issues. This includes real-time tracking of key metrics such as response time, error rates, and system resource utilization.
